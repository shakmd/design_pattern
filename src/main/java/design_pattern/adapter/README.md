# Adapter Pattern

The Adapter Pattern converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect.</br>
Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.>/br>


There is a lot of similarity between Adapter, Proxy and Decorator.
While there are lot of similarities between Proxy and Decorator at the UML level but still we should see the pattern with their intent instead of the UML.</br>

Adapter is different from Decorator as Decorator adds responsibility to an existing object whereas the sole purpose of Adapter is to make incompatible interfaces compatible.</br>

Adapter is different from Proxy as Proxy has the same interface as the actual object(it just add extra authentication, caching mechanism etc before the actual call to the object is made).
