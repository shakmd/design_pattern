# Proxy Pattern

The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.</br>

Please read the README.md of Adapter Pattern to know more differences between the two patterns.</br>

Proxy and Decorator are lot similar at the UML level. For example: both the patterns have a class that implements and compose the same interface.</br>
But if look at their respective intent, we can clearly see the differences.</br>
For example: Decorator adds additional responsibility(or change behaviour) to an existing object whereas Proxy only acts as placeholder but does not add any extra behaviour to underlying object.</br>

There are three intents/types/ways of Proxy Pattern:</br>
- Remote Proxy Pattern
- Virtual Proxy Pattern
- Protection Proxy Pattern
