# oop_design_pattern

This repo contains various OOP Design Patterns as introduced by GangOfFour<br>

Highly inspired from this [book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns), this [book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-design/0596007124/) and most importantly [Christopher Okhravi's Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrhzvIcii6GNjpARdnO4ueTUAVR9eMBpc)
